__HIDEAWAY COTTAGE:__

__Hideaway Cottage welcomed its first guests over 20 years ago\. Tucked away in the heart of the Bushcamp it was originally called “Number 4” but quickly earned the rather more romantic title of “Honeymoon Cottage” when guests began to choose it as their honeymoon destination; enjoying the privacy, seclusion and ocean views that it offered\. __

Now we’ve decided to ease the pressure on those guests who may not be planning a honeymoon just yet\. So we invite you to visit Hideaway Cottage, because that’s exactly what it is … hidden away, surrounded by bush at the end of a winding wooden walkway\. 

Once settled in the cottage the only thing likely to disturb you is the sound of the waves crashing on the beach below, or an inquisitive Loerie bird on your private wooden deck, which has panoramic views over the ocean towards Vic Bay\.

Hideaway Cottage offers simple comforts and rustic charm with no television and no WiFi, just an abundance of peace and quiet to really escape from it all…

__LAGOON VIEW:__

__Over the years Lagoon View has built a loyal following of guests who return, year after year, to enjoy the unsurpassable views from the private wooden deck\.__ 

On approaching the entrance to the cabin you’d be forgiven for thinking it simple and unassuming – but as you open the door you’re immediately drawn to the views over the ocean and lagoon, which envelop the sitting area\.  

The cabin itself is simple and rustic but comfortable, with accommodation for 4 people in 2 bedrooms with a shared bathroom\. 

Lagoon View is larger than the neighbouring ‘Sunrise Ridge’\. Both cabins are situated on a 2\-hectare portion of the Bushcamp, which allows guests the opportunity to stroll in open areas and enjoy the views from the very top of the hill\. 

Once the sun has set you can enjoy the warmth of the indoor fireplace or light a fire in the braai on the deck, watch the lights of the village come to life and listen to the ocean rolling in …

__This cosy log cabin__ __is perfect for the adventure\-loving family or a group of friends looking for a break away…__

A wooden boardwalk leads through the bush and down to the front door of Loerie Cabin, which opens onto the middle level with kitchen with breakfast bar\. A narrow set of wooden steps then leads up to the loft area with three single beds tucked under the eaves, with porthole views of Wilderness beach\. 

The main sleeping area is located on the lower level of the cabin with a double bed and sitting area\. From here you access the private wooden deck which is surrounded by bush, framing the ocean views\. The deck can only be accessed from the cabin, so you can enjoy total seclusion as you relax with your evening sundowners\.

Everything in Loerie Cabin is open plan, apart form the bathroom, so it’s an ideal choice for a few good friends or families with older children – as the narrow steps are hazardous for very young ones

There’s no television or WiFi in the cabin, offering a real holiday away from the digital overload of day to day life…

The cabin is rustic but comfortable with a sitting area, kitchenette, double bedroom and bathroom with shower\.

The rocking chair facing the window is the perfect place to rock back and watch the waves and the whales, because this is arguably the best dolphin and whale\-watching window on the Garden Route

The apartment itself is fully open\-plan, encompassing dining, living, sleeping and bathroom areas, with no walls or doors to interrupt the flow of space and light\. Although open plan, it has many separate and distinct areas to enjoy at different times of the day

This wonderful space can be enjoyed whatever the weather\. Soak up the sun on the sun\-loungers as the braai sparks to life, lie back on the king size bed while watching an MNet movie or watch an electrical storm roll out over the ocean as you relax on the couch or soak in the roll top bath…
