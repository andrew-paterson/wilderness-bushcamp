## Things to do

If you like to get out and about and explore the local area then there are numerous hikes, trails and scenic drives in and around Wilderness and in the surrounding towns of Knysna, Plett, Mossel Bay and Sedgefield\.

For many, the main attraction is the range of surf spots along this beautiful stretch of coast … but if you prefer to stay on dry land and golf’s your thing, you’ll be spoilt for choice with the world class golf courses at Fancourt, Pezula in Knysna and Ernie Els’ signature course at Oubaai

Wilderness and the Garden Route also offer some amazing opportunities to spice up your trip with a little excitement and adventure\. From abseiling in Wilderness and Knysna, to bungee jumping at Storms River, or boat based whale watching in Plettenberg Bay

If you’re looking for personal recommendations then maybe consider this very special list, which was written many years ago by John Pfaff, who built the Wilderness Bushcamp and Milkwood Village\. 

### My Favourite Things – by John Pfaff

{{< _shared/srcset-element class="width-100" image_path="/images/blog/johns-favourite-things/johns-favourite-things-900w.jpg" alt="John's favoutite things">}}

In 1972 newlyweds, John and Ann Pfaff, arrived in George looking for somewhere to settle and make a home\.

John was an enthusiastic surfer and the break at Vic Bay played a big part in their decision to stay in the area\.

{{< _shared/srcset-element class="width-100" image_path="/images/blog/johns-favourite-things/john-pfaff-surfing-900w.jpg" alt="John Pfaff surfing">}}

For two years they lived in the Vic Bay caravan park then, in 1980, they moved to Wilderness\.

They lived and worked in the village when it was little more than a handful of buildings and a few small businesses\. The old Wilderness Hotel was the focal point of village life and the Milkwood Village didn’t exist\.

In the early 80s John and Ann bought Aloe Heights; the hill where the Bushcamp is now located\. They made a road to the top then set about building a home for their family\. They moved into Aloe House with their two children, and it has been the family home ever since\.

It was John’s dream to create Milkwood Village; an area that might become the heart of Wilderness and act as a meeting place for locals and visitors alike\. However, he faced a major challenge in protecting the old Milkwood trees that were at the centre of his proposed development\.

Thankfully not one tree was harmed and those beautiful old Milkwood trees are now the focal point of Milkwood Village\. They’re also testament to John’s desire to see Wilderness going from strength to strength, while retaining its natural beauty and charm\.

Up at the Bushcamp, John built the first log cabin in 1994, and the first guests visited soon after\. Loerie Cabin was soon followed by Hideaway Cottage, Lagoon View, Sunrise Ridge and, most recently, Forest Rise and Bird Haven\. 

John passed away in 2010 but he will always be part of Wilderness, partly because he helped to shape the landscape of the village that you see today\.

Wilderness was his favourite place on earth and he wanted everyone to recognise the same magical beauty that he discovered all those years ago\.

It made him happy when people shared his love of the area; the sea, the beaches, the bush and the forest, so he drew up this ‘Must\-Do’ list for visitors to the Bushcamp\.
