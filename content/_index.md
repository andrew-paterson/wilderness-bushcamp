__Wilderness Bushcamp offers self catering accommodation set in 9 hectares of indigenous bush and some of the finest views in Wilderness.__

Nestled on a hilltop, overlooking the Indian Ocean, this hidden gem has been welcoming guests from all over the world for over 20 years - and there really is something for everyone…

From log cabins for adventurous families looking for a digital detox, to contemporary cottages for families or groups of friends who want to enjoy the peace and seclusion of this hilltop haven, with modern comforts.

Couples can choose between a cosy studio apartment, a rustic hideaway cottage, or the very special Loft with its open-plan splendour and far reaching views over the ocean.

There’s plenty of space to stretch your legs on the 9-hectare property, which is located 400m above Wilderness village. It’s a short walk or drive down the hill into the heart of the village, then on to the beach, the lagoon and beyond.

Wilderness Bushcamp is the perfect base from which to explore the Garden Route or, alternatively, settle back on your private deck and watch the ocean roll in while you sip your morning coffee, relax with a sundowner or just drink in the sea air and never-ending views…
