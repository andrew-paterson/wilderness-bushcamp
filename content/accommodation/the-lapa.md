Each unit has its own private deck with outdoor dining area but not all of the units are equipped with a braai, so guests are welcome to make use of the communal lapa area…

The Lapa is situated in close proximity to Loerie Cabin, Hideaway Cottage and Aloe Studio, but is available for all guests to use and enjoy.

If guests are interested in booking out the whole Bushcamp for a group of people then it’s possible to secure exclusive use of The Lapa so that guests can gather there to enjoy meals together. 

It can accommodate up to 30 guests comfortably in the outside and indoor eating areas. There's a braai and pizza oven as well as a small, fully equipped kitchen with serving counter. 

The Lapa looks out over the ocean and is the perfect place to sit and watch the dolphins by day, but it’s probably best suited for late afternoon braais when you can enjoy the last few rays of sun while cooking up a potjie or a pizza with friends...

## LAPA RULES: 

Please don’t leave fires unattended

No music or noise after 10pm 

Please clean up after yourselves so that others can also enjoy the shared space

Please pack away or throw away unwanted bits of food and don’t leave food in The Lapa overnight 

**BUSH FIRES:**

Over the last 20 years there have been 3 serious bush fires in the Wilderness area. 

To reduce the risk of bush fire we decided to remove the individual braais from the cabins located in denser bush (Loerie Cabin and Hideaway Cottage) However, these two cabins are just a few steps away from The Lapa so guests don't have to walk far to braai and can even take their food back to their cabins to enjoy on the deck

Please remember not to leave fires unattended, even to pop back to your cabin
