While each unit has its own private deck with outdoor dining area, not all of the units are equipped with a braai, so guests are welcome to make use of the communal area, known as the Lapa…

The Lapa is situated in close proximity to Loerie Cabin, Hideaway Cottage and Aloe Studio, but is available for all guests to use and enjoy\.

If guests are interested in booking out the whole Bushcamp for a group of people then it’s possible to secure exclusive use of the Lapa so that guests can gather there to enjoy meals together\. It can accommodate up to 30 guests comfortably\. There is a braai and pizza oven as well as a small, fully equipped kitchen with serving counter and an undercover eating area\. 

The Lapa looks out over the ocean and can be enjoyed at any time of the day\. It’s the perfect place to sit and watch the dolphins by day, but it’s perhaps best suited for evening braais\.

## BUSH FIRES

Over the last 20 years there have been 3 serious bush fires in the Wilderness area\. 

This is the reason we have removed individual braais from the cottages that are situated in denser bush \(Loerie Cabin, Hideaway Cottage and Aloe Studio\) However, these are all a short walk from the Lapa, so guests can enjoy the convenience of this braai area with pizza oven\.

Out of consideration for fellow guests please be aware of the Lapa Rules:

Please don’t leave fires unattended

No music or noise after 10pm 

Please clean up after yourselves so that others can also enjoy the shared space

Please pack away or throw away unwanted bits of food and don’t leave food in the Lapa overnight\.
