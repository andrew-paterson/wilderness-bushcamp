**Over the years Lagoon View has built a loyal following of guests who return, year after year, to enjoy the unsurpassable views from the private wooden deck.** 

On approaching the cabin you’d be forgiven for thinking it simple and unassuming, but step inside and you’re immediately drawn to the views over the ocean and lagoon, which envelop the sitting area.  

The cabin itself is rustic but comfortable, with accommodation for 4 people in 2 bedrooms with a shared bathroom. 

Lagoon View is larger than the neighbouring ‘Sunrise Ridge’. Both cabins are situated on a 2-hectare portion of the Bushcamp, which allows guests the opportunity to stroll in open areas and enjoy the views from the very top of the hill. 

Once the sun has set you can light a fire in the braai on the deck as you watch the lights of the village come to life and listen to the ocean rolling in …
