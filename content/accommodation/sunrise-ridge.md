**As the name suggests, Sunrise Ridge is perfectly positioned to watch the sun rising over the ocean and Wilderness lagoon…**

The unique feature of this cabin is that it's North and East facing, which means it's perfectly positioned to enjoy the sunrise and sunset from the private deck.

A wooden boardwalk leads through the foliage to the cabin and large wooden deck with private braai. 

The cabin is rustic but comfortable with a sitting area, kitchenette, breakfast nook, double bedroom and bathroom with shower.  

It’s spacious for two and can be enjoyed all year round. Enjoy a glass of wine on the deck while gazing out over the lagoon on a summer’s evening or, in cooler weather, enjoy the view from the comfort of the cosy sofa.

There are no digital distractions in Sunrise Ridge but there is a well stocked bookcase…
