__Quite simply, The Loft is as special as it looks…__

This unique apartment is built on an elevated vantage point on a hill overlooking Wilderness village and the Indian Ocean\. Its position combined with a wall of windows overlooking the ocean, results in a mesmerising view that can occupy you all day long\.

The rocking chair facing the window is the perfect place to rock back and watch the waves and the whales, because this is arguably the best dolphin and whale\-watching window on the Garden Route

The apartment itself is fully open\-plan, encompassing dining, living, sleeping and bathroom areas, with no walls or doors to interrupt the flow of space and light\. Although open plan, it has many separate and distinct areas to enjoy at different times of the day

This wonderful space can be enjoyed whatever the weather\. Soak up the sun on the sun\-loungers as the braai sparks to life, lie back on the king size bed while watching an MNet movie or watch an electrical storm roll out over the ocean as you relax on the couch or soak in the roll top bath…
