**Aloe Loft offers an abundance of ocean views and elegant comfort. This is open plan living at its finest.**

The loft encompasses dining, living, sleeping and bathroom areas, with no walls or doors to interrupt the beautiful flow of space and light.

A soak in the roll top bath can be accompanied by your favourite MNet movie or views over the Ocean.

This wonderful space can be enjoyed whatever the weather. There’s nothing more majestic than watching an electrical storm roll out over the ocean as you relax on the couch or lie back on the king size bed, or watch the dolphins surf from the backline and enjoy the best whale spotting window in the region.
