**The Loft really is as special as it looks…**

This unique apartment is built on an elevated vantage point on a hill overlooking Wilderness village and the Indian Ocean. This position, combined with an expanse of ocean-facing windows, results in a mesmerising view that can occupy you all day long.

The apartment itself is fully open-plan, encompassing dining, living, sleeping and bathroom areas, with no walls or doors to interrupt the flow of space and light.

This wonderful space can be enjoyed whatever the weather. Soak up the sun on your private patio as the braai sparks to life, snuggle up on the king-size bed while watching an MNet movie or watch an electrical storm roll out over the ocean as you soak in the roll top bath. 

Alternatively, rock back and watch the waves and the whales, because this is arguably the best dolphin and whale watching window on the whole of the Garden Route...
