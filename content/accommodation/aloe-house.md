**Aloe House is perched on the edge of a hill overlooking the Indian Ocean and Wilderness lagoon**. **From this unique vantage point you can enjoy the sunrise, the sunset and all the glorious views in between…**

The wraparound deck is the standout feature of the house. You’ll be spoilt for choice with views of Wilderness lagoon, Wilderness beach, Kaaimans River and Vic Bay. There’s also a swimming pool and patio area with uninterrupted views over Wilderness beach; the prefect place for whale and dolphin watching.

Indoors, the large open-plan kitchen and dining area is tailor-made for entertaining, with an abundance of space to prepare food and a large dining table where meals can be enjoyed together.

Beyond the kitchen is a cosy lounge with sofas and an indoor fireplace. Adjacent to this is a games room laid out for lounging and watching the ocean. This is a popular room with children, who love to draw, read and play in this relaxed space.

The house has three bedrooms, two with en-suite bathrooms while the third has a large private bathroom across the corridor. Each bedroom faces onto the pool and patio area with views over the ocean.

**Aloe House is available for rent during December and January only.**
