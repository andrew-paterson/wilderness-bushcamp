**Aloe House sits on top of a hill overlooking Wilderness beach and Wilderness lagoon**

**From this magnificent vantage point you can enjoy the sunrise, the sunset and all the glorious views in between…**

A discreet path along the side of the Reception leads to the main entrance. From there a corridor leads to 3 double bedrooms; all newly renovated and tastefully furnished. Two rooms have en-suite facilities while the third room has a large private bathroom across the corridor. Each room has large sliding doors that open onto the pool area, which in turn overlooks the ocean.

The large open-plan kitchen and dining area is the perfect place for entertaining, with an abundance of space to prepare food and a large dining table where meals can be enjoyed.

Beyond the kitchen is a cosy lounge with sofas and DSTV and an indoor fireplace. Adjacent to this is a games room with pool table and comfortable sofa for lounging and watching the ocean. This is a popular room with the children, who love to draw and read and play in this relaxed space.

The wraparound deck offers views of Wilderness lagoon, Wilderness beach, Kaaimans River and Vic Bay. Plus there’s the swimming pool and patio area with uninterrupted views over Wilderness beach. So, if you don’t feel like joining your friends or loved ones for a day on the beach, you can watch them from your vantage point on the top of the hill, or keep a look out for dolphins and whales by day and marvel at the phosphorous in the sea at night.

**This is a great place to enjoy a weekend with friends; **wake up to the ocean, take a dip in the pool, _play_ some pool, enjoy breakfast on the patio, head down to the beach, go canoeing on the lagoon, enjoy a few beers on your return while looking out over the ocean, light a braai, watch the sun set, enjoy a movie, go to sleep to the sound of the ocean … then wake up and do it all over again.
