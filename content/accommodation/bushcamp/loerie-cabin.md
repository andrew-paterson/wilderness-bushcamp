__This cosy log cabin__ __is perfect for the adventure\-loving family or a group of friends looking for a break away…__

A wooden boardwalk leads through the bush and down to the front door of Loerie Cabin, which opens onto the middle level with kitchen with breakfast bar\. A narrow set of wooden steps then leads up to the loft area with three single beds tucked under the eaves, with porthole views of Wilderness beach\. 

The main sleeping area is located on the lower level of the cabin with a double bed and sitting area\. From here you access the private wooden deck which is surrounded by bush, framing the ocean views\. The deck can only be accessed from the cabin, so you can enjoy total seclusion as you relax with your evening sundowners\.

Everything in Loerie Cabin is open plan, apart form the bathroom, so it’s an ideal choice for a few good friends or families with older children – as the narrow steps are hazardous for very young ones

There’s no television or WiFi in the cabin, offering a real holiday away from the digital overload of day to day life…
