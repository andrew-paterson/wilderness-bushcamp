This is one of our most popular cabins, with a private deck that offers glorious views of Wilderness lagoon and the ocean. There’s no better place to watch the sun rise while you enjoy your early morning cup of coffee…

Slightly bigger than the neighbouring ‘Sunset Ridge’ – this cabin offers accommodation for upto 4 people in one double room and one twin room. Sunset Ridge and Lagoon View are set on a 2-hectare portion of the estate, which allows guests the opportunity to stroll in open areas and enjoy the views from the very top of the hill. Once the sun has set you can enjoy the warmth of the indoor fireplace or light a fire in the braai on your private deck.
