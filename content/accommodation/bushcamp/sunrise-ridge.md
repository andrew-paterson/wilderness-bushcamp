**Situated in a less densely vegetated area of the Bushcamp, this cabin is built on the upper section of the hill, known as Sunset Ridge.**

A wooden boardwalk leads down to the cabin and onto a large wooden deck, which has unobstructed views over Wilderness lagoon, the ocean and the mountains. This cabin is spacious, comfortable and can be enjoyed all year round; light the braai and enjoy a glass of wine while gazing out over the lagoon on a summerâ€™s evening, or, in cooler weather, enjoy the view from the comfort of your chair by the cosy indoor fireplace.
