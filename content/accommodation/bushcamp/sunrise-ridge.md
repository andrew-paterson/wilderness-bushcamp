__As the name suggests, Sunrise Ridge is perfectly positioned to watch the sun rising over the ocean and Wilderness lagoon…__

The unique feature of this cabin, and the neighbouring Lagoon View, is that it is North and East facing, positioning it perfectly to enjoy the sunrise and sunset from the private deck

A wooden boardwalk leads through the foliage to the cabin itself, and onto a large wooden deck with a private braai\. 

The cabin is rustic but comfortable with a sitting area, kitchenette, double bedroom and bathroom with shower\.  

It’s spacious for two and can be enjoyed all year round\. Enjoy a glass of wine while gazing out over the lagoon on a summer’s evening, or, in cooler weather, enjoy the view from the comfort of your chair by the cosy indoor fireplace\.

There are no digital distractions in Sunrise Ridge but there is a well stocked bookcase…
