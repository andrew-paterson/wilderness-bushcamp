A wooden boardwalk leads down to this cosy wooden cabin, built for two. Step out of bed and onto your deck to enjoy the sun rise over the lagoon and the ocean,

**Situated in a less densely vegetated area of the Bushcamp, this cabin is built on the upper section of the hill, known as Sunset Ridge.**

A wooden boardwalk leads down to the cabin and onto a large wooden deck, which has unobstructed views over Wilderness lagoon, the ocean and the mountains. This cabin is spacious, comfortable and can be enjoyed all year round; light the braai and enjoy a glass of wine while gazing out over the lagoon on a summer’s evening, or, in cooler weather, enjoy the view from the comfort of your chair by the cosy indoor fireplace.
