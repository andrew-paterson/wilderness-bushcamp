**Tucked away in the heart of the Bushcamp, this cabin earned its name after guests started requesting ‘the hideaway cottage’.** **Discreetly located at the end of a wooden walkway and hidden amongst dense bush, this is the perfect choice for those who don’t want to be disturbed…**

Many of our guests have chosen this cottage as their hideaway destination; enjoying the privacy, seclusion and beautiful ocean views. Once settled in, the only thing likely to disturb you is the sound of the waves crashing on the beach below, or an inquisitive Loerie bird on your private wooden deck, which has panoramic views over Kaaimans River, Vic Bay and along Wilderness beach all the way to Gericke’s point.
