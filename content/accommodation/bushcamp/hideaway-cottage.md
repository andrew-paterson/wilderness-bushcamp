__Hideaway Cottage welcomed its first guests over 20 years ago\. Tucked away in the heart of the Bushcamp it was originally called “Number 4” but quickly earned the rather more romantic title of “Honeymoon Cottage” when guests began to choose it as their honeymoon destination; enjoying the privacy, seclusion and ocean views that it offered\.__

Now we’ve decided to ease the pressure on those guests who may not be planning a honeymoon just yet\. So we invite you to visit Hideaway Cottage, because that’s exactly what it is … hidden away, surrounded by bush at the end of a winding wooden walkway\. 

Once settled in the cottage the only thing likely to disturb you is the sound of the waves crashing on the beach below, or an inquisitive Loerie bird on your private wooden deck, which has panoramic views over the ocean towards Vic Bay\.

Hideaway Cottage offers simple comforts and rustic charm with no television and no WiFi, just an abundance of peace and quiet to really escape from it all…

__Features__

- Kitchen with fridge, stove, toaster and kettle\.
- Lounge area
- Bathroom with shower
- Bedroom with double bed
- Private deck with ocean views
- __No TV or WiFi__
- __The braai has been removed from this unit to eliminate the risk of bush fires, but guests are welcome to make use of the lapa, which is just a few steps away__
