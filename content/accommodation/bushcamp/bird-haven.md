This beautifully appointed cottage sits in an area that was once the uppermost section of a bird sanctuary. The surrounding fynbos and vegetation still teems with birdlife, so bring your binocularsâ€¦

Bird Haven has been carefully designed to offer rustic charm and modern comfort in this most tranquil of settings, with views over the indigenous forest to one side and a sweeping vista over the lakes, lagoon and ocean from the covered deck.

The living area is comfortably equipped with a fully fitted kitchen, log burning stove, dining area and sitting area. Outside, the private deck with stone-built braai offers uninterrupted views of the whole of the Wilderness.
