Forest Rise is the almost identical twin of Bird Haven. Built on the uppermost section of the hill, this cabin has a few extra-special tweaks, which make it the perfect choice for a young family.

Forest Rise has been carefully designed to offer rustic charm and modern comfort in a peaceful setting where the only thing likely to disturb you is the local birdlife. The private deck with stone-built braai offers views over the ocean and lagoon. It also has a slide for the children to gain easy access to the enclosed garden below. This is the perfect place to relax and play for young families.

The living area is comfortably equipped with a fully fitted kitchen, log burning stove, dining area and sitting area.

There are two bedrooms; one double and one twin. Each bedroom has its own en-suite shower room. Outside is an outdoor shower at the rear of the cabin, perfect for rinsing off the sand after a long day at the beach.

**Please Note: There is no television in this unit - but there is free Wifi and a well-stocked bookcase**
