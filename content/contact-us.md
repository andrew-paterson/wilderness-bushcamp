## Directions

Wilderness is located just off the N2, approx 15km from George.

Once you turn off the N2 into Wilderness take your first left turn onto Beacon Road. The road will take you past Milkwood Village and will then wind uphill, getting gradually steeper.

Keep going until you see the main house and parking area.  
We’ve included a few pictures to help show you the way…
