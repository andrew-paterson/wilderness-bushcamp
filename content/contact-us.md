## Directions

Wilderness is located just off the N2, approx 15km from George.

Once you turn off the N2 into Wilderness take an immediate left turn onto Beacon Road. 

Follow Beacon Road past Milkwood Village and past the Kwik Spar. The road will start to narrow and then wind uphill, getting gradually steeper. Don’t turn right into the entrance to the Bird Sanctuary. This is a private residential estate. Instead follow the road upwards.

The road will twist and turn for approx. 300m and gets very steep in parts, but keep going until you reach the top with the paved parking area. 

When you see this view you have reached your destination…
