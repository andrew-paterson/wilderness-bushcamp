      <guid>http://www.wildernessbushcamp.co.za/the-lapa/</guid>
      <description>While each unit has its own private deck with outdoor dining area, not all of the units are equipped with a braai, so guests are welcome to make use of the communal area, known as the Lapa…
The Lapa is situated in close proximity to Loerie Cabin, Hideaway Cottage and Aloe Studio, but is available for all guests to use and enjoy.
If guests are interested in booking out the whole Bushcamp for a group of people then it’s possible to secure exclusive use of the Lapa so that guests can gather there to enjoy meals together.</description>
